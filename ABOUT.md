# About Flytta
Flytta is a free and open source animation app built with GTK4. It is aimed for it being a simple, easy to use, and fast application.

## Why does this exist?
I'm tired of Adobe Animate and Adobe products in general. Other than that, I have a brother who uses Adobe Animate and he always complains everyday about it bugging. I'm not sure why, but I'm tired of it. So, I tried to find free alternatives, but all of them are either proprietary, or they're not free, or they're not open source, and in my opinion they're all bad. So, I decided to make my own animation program that is fast, not crashing once everyday, and a great FOSS alternative to Adobe Animate. 

## Our Goal
Our goals for this project is that we want to make it as easy as possible to use, and to make it as fast as possible. We also want to make it not too buggy as well, so that you can use it without banging your table so hard.
